GNOME is the only desktop that secures privileged wayland protocols like screencopy. KDE and Sway have plans <sup>([KDE](https://invent.kde.org/plasma/xdg-desktop-portal-kde/-/issues/7), [Sway](https://github.com/swaywm/sway/issues/2333))</sup> to fix this. This means that on non-GNOME systems, applications can access screen content of the entire desktop. This implicitly includes the content of other applications. It's primarily for this reason that GNOME images are recommended.
