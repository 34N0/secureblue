Secureblue
================

The Secureblue Profile is specifically configured for local user accounts.

FEATURES
---------------------------

faillock::
    Enable account locking mechanisms to protect against brute-force
    login attempts. When a specified number of failed authentication
    attempts occur within a defined time frame, the user account
    will be temporarily locked, preventing further login attempts.

fingerprint::
    Enable authentication with fingerprint reader through *pam_fprintd*.
    This feature allows users to log in using their biometric fingerprint
    data, adding an additional layer of security while improving user
    convenience during the authentication process.
